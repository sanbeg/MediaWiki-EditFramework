MediaWiki-EditFramework version 0.01
====================================

This is a higher level framework for editing MediaWiki pages.  

This is the framework that I've been using for the past few years to run an
archiving bot.  The main features that it has over lower-level frameworks
are:

* Pages are represented as objects.  This allows the page to store additional
information, such as the last updated timestamp when they were retrieved.
This time stamp is then passed back to the server when the page is edited,
to allow it to properly detect edit conflicts.

* The module supports specified a write_prefix, which is appended to pages
titles when editing a page.  This makes it easier to create a test mode for
a bot script.  By specifying the write prefix in your own user space, the
bot will retrieve the normal pages, but the modifications will be written to
user space so you can review them without impacting others.
